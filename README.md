# Actions with Lambda

A workflow of Lambda's deployment using `appleboy/lambda-action@v0.2.0`.

### Steps

###### 6 steps in total

1. Create your lambda files (index.py, log.py).
2. Add `requirements.txt` file with your dependencies.
3. Add `.gitignore` file to avoid push of environment variables or dependencies folders to GitHub.
4. Add `main.yml` file to `.github/workflows`.
5. Setup your secrets into the repository (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`).
6. Execute the command `git push -u origin main`

###### Then, we made it :D
